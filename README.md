# food-site

## Project Description:
The project involves the development of a basic website for a food service, utilizing technologies such as node.js (Express.js), hbs, and css (scss). The website consists of four main pages: home, menu, signin, and signup.
The home and menu pages retrieve data from a JSON backend and display it on the website. The user interface is designed to validate input fields, and in case of incomplete input for signin or signup, the backend renders error messages to guide the user. Additionally, upon successful registration, a welcome message is sent to the user's email address.
To achieve this functionality, the project utilizes node.js with the Express.js framework for server-side development. The hbs templating engine is used for rendering dynamic content on the website. The project also involves CSS styling, with a particular emphasis on SCSS (Sass) for efficient and maintainable styling.
